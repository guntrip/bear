## Fat Bear River Crossing

The bears are all fat and ready to hiberinate but there's a river in the way! Your job is to maneuver the fat bears onto your rickety boat and transport them across. Make sure not to overload or unbalance your boat though, I'm not sure if bears float.

Little web-based game about bears for Ludum Dare 49 Compo. The theme is **unstable**.
